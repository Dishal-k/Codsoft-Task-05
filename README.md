AI Face Detection and Recognition System This project develops an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. It uses pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors. Additionally, face recognition capabilities are implemented using techniques such as Siamese networks or ArcFace.
